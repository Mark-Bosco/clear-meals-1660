# **üßë‚Äçüíª For Developers Only! üë©‚Äçüíª**

---

## üìÉ Prerequisites
- [Node.js (version 14 or later)](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- npm or yarn
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/more/expo-cli/) (install globally via `npm add expo`)
- [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/) (if you plan to work on backend functions `install via npm install -g firebase-tools`)

--- 

## üë∂ Initial Setup
1. Navigate to where you want to store the project
2. Clone the repository and enter the directory
    - `git clone https://github.com/Mark-Bosco/clear-meals-1660.git`
    - `cd clear-meals-1660`
3. In the project root, install the main project dependencies
    - `npm install`
4. If working on Firebase functions, navigate to the functions directory and install its dependencies:
    - `cd functions`
    - `npm install`
    - `cd ..` (Move back to the root directory)

--- 

## üïµÔ∏è Configuring Secrets and Enviornment Variables
1. Pull up the Google doc I have shared containing the secrets
2. Create a `.env` file and paste in the contents
    - *This is an environment variables file containing configuration keys for Firebase and OAuth authentication*
3. Create a `google-services.json` file and paste in the contents
    - *This is the Firebase configuration file specifically for Android applications*
4. Create a `serviceAccountKey.json` file and paste in the contents
    - *This is a Firebase Admin SDK credential file used for server-side authentication*
5. Create a `GoogleService-Info.plist` file and paste in the contents
    - *This is the Firebase configuration file specifically for IOS applications*

--- 

## üöó Running the Project
1. Start the Expo Development Server by entering the following command while in the project root:
    - `npx expo start`
2. Use an emulator or the Expo Go app on your mobile device to preview the application
    - Both IOS and Android are supproted
    - There may be some visual bugs on IOS
    - You may get native code errors if running in Expo Go as the native libraries are not available. Use a native development build to test Google sign in functionality. 

--- 

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Firebase Functions 
1. If your work involves backend updates, log in to Firebase:
    - `firebase login`
2. Make your code changes in `/functions` and commit them to GitHub
3. Deploy the new or updated functions with: `firebase deploy --only functions`

## üîí Google Authentication
1. Using a Google Authentication method requires additional configuration of the app in Firebase console. Follow the instructions [in the authentication library docs](https://react-native-google-signin.github.io/docs/setting-up/get-config-file) to configure Firebase and Google Authentication for your platform and build method.
2. Google Authentication only works with a native build locally or on EAS, not Expo Go, for Android, as it requires native libraries.

--- 

## üèóÔ∏è Creating a New Build
1. Create an Expo account and join the 1660 organization
2. Install the Expo EAS CLI using this terminal command: `npm install -g eas-cli`
3. Login to your Expo account in the terminal: `eas login`
4. Increment `version` in `app.config.js` (i.e. 1.0.0 --> 1.0.1)
5. Make sure all your changes are committed to git
7. Run the build command: `eas build --platform android --profile preview`
    - Use the exisiting keystore if prompted
    - If you run into issues regarding secrets, temporarily adjust the `.gitignore` as indicated by the comments
    - Check the progress of the build [here](https://expo.dev/accounts/cs1660/projects/clear-meals-1660/builds)
